    "text": "5. Relevant Related work (Literature Review)\nWe analyzed six research articles in relation to our project topic:\n1)  Climatic influence on electricity consumption: The case of Singapore and Hong Kong - Singapore’s yearly electricity consumption may rise by 3-4% for every degree Celsius that the temperature rises, with the residential sector bearing most of the increase. Singapore’s major electricity user, with less seasonality than Hong Kong, is the industrial sector. The overall fluctuation is generally low, while the demand for power is higher in the commercial and residential sectors during the hotter months. The impact of temperature variations on power usage is assessed using two analytical techniques in this study: the time-series approach (uses monthly data from 1990 to 2015) and the decomposition approach (divides consumption into trend, seasonal, cyclical, and irregular components). The findings indicate that, while temperature has a statistically significant impact on energy use, particularly in the residential sector, the total effect is not as strong as it is in Hong Kong.\n2) Impact of climate change and socioeconomic factors on domestic energy consumption: The case of Hong Kong and Singapore -  The study examines Singapore’s energy usage using LMG (Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold Method) and PMVD (Proportional Marginal Variance Decomposition) techniques, and it finds that climatic factors such as the heat index and monsoon have a greater impact than population and GDP. According to the Generalized Additive Model (log-transformed to account for non-linear relationships) for Energy Consumption, humidity and temperature increase rather than decrease energy consumption. Using six CMIP5 models, future climate forecasts forecast higher energy demand, particularly in the residential sector. By 2100, Singapore’s environment is expected to stay tropical rainforest and extend north which could change the regional energy trends.\n3) Impact of climate change on dengue fever epidemics in South and Southeast Asian settings: A modelling study -\nThe study examines dengue transmission in Singapore using an SEI-SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model. To account for temperature-dependent characteristics including bite rate, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito mortality rate, it divides human and mosquito populations into several stages of infection. Future temperatures and precipitation under three climate change scenarios are simulated using climate models from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Dengue forecasts for Singapore are based on daily rainfall and temperature data from 2012 to 2020. The most important temperature-dependent parameters were identified by uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, which revealed that dengue transmission is greatly enhanced by higher mosquito biting frequency and lower death in ideal warm conditions.\n4) Impact of extreme weather on dengue fever infection in four Asian countries: A modelling analysis -\nThe paper analyzes dengue risk in each study location using a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) and a two-stage meta-analysis. The DLNM accounts for nonlinear connections by capturing the delayed impacts of rainfall and temperature on dengue risk. To account for overdispersion of dengue cases, the study uses a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a quasi-Poisson Distribution. Public holidays, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and temperature are examples of independent variables. For regional adjustment, the Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) methodology is employed, which reduces estimation errors and yields more trustworthy country-specific results by enabling smaller sample sites to draw strength from bigger datasets.\n5) A Review and Case Analysis of the Impact of Weather Factors on Public Transportation in Singapore - The study investigates how weather factors affect the efficiency of transportation. High temperatures increase the number of passengers on the MRT, and heavy rains results in lengthier bus wait times, according to a Pearson correlation test. A multivariate linear regression model measures how each weather variable affects the effectiveness of public transportation. Demand patterns are impacted by temperature, while delays are most affected by rainfall. Bus and train delays are predicted with good accuracy (approx. 85%) via a Random Forest machine learning algorithm."

    "section": "2. Objective",
    "text": "2. Objective\nOur project aims to address several critical problems related to climate change in Singapore. One of the key objectives is to understand long-term climate trends by visualizing historical weather data, which will allow us to identify patterns such as rising temperatures, increased humidity, and extreme weather events.\nAnother important aspect of this study is examining the health impacts of climate change. By correlating weather data with records from the National Environment Agency (NEA), we aim to study the increase in the spread of vector-borne diseases like dengue. Dengue is one of the major climate-related health issues in Singapore, as warmer temperatures and increased rainfall create ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes, leading to a surge in dengue cases. Understanding this links can help public health authorities implement better preventive measures and policies to mitigate health risks associated with climate change.\nIn addition to health concerns, climate change also has significant implications for energy consumption. As temperatures rise, the demand for electricity, particularly for cooling purposes, is expected to increase. Investigating these patterns will help us assess the impact of climate change on Singapore’s energy needs and inform sustainable energy policies that balance efficiency and environmental responsibility.\nFurthermore, extreme weather events can disrupt transportation networks and affect commuting behaviors. Our project will explore the impact of weather conditions on taxi and hitch-hiring demand. By analysing these trends, we aim to provide insights that can support transportation planning and improve urban mobility resilience in the face of climate change.\nOverall, our project seeks to provide actionable insights that can guide policymakers, urban planners, and public health officials in developing effective climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. By presenting our findings through visual analytics, we aim to enhance awareness of climate challenges and contribute to Singapore’s efforts in building a more climate-resilient future."

    "text": "3. The Data sets\nTo analyse the impact of climate change on various aspects of daily life in Singapore, we will integrate multiple data sets from different government agencies. Our primary data set will be historical weather data from the Meteorological Service Singapore, which will provide information on temperature trends, rainfall patterns, humidity levels, and extreme weather events over the years. This data will serve as the foundation for identifying climate-related changes and their potential consequences.\nIn addition to weather data, we will incorporate a few other data sets with the following purposes:\n1. Electricity consumption statistics from the Energy Market Authority (EMA): This data set will allow us to examine the correlation between rising temperatures and increased electricity demand.\n2.Dengue case data from the National Environment Agency (NEA): By correlating dengue incidence rates with weather patterns, we aim to identify trends and evaluate the public health implications of climate change.\n3. Private hire vehicle data from the Land Transport Authority (LTA): We will investigate how extreme weather events influence commuting behaviors and transport demand. Analysing fluctuations in taxi and ride-hailing demand during different weather conditions will provide insights into urban mobility patterns as well.\nBy combining these data sets, our project will provide a comprehensive analysis of how climate change affects various aspects of everyday life in Singapore."

    "text": "1\nProject Proposal Summary\nMotivation & Background\nThe impact of Climate change is becoming more obvious and is beginning to have a significant impact on our daily lives.  This is especially for Singapore, a tropical island nation facing rising temperatures, increased humidity, frequent extreme weather events, and rising sea levels.  In the past, these changes were subtle but has rapidly led to built-up impact on daily life of Singapore residents. Singapore’s mean temperatures have been rising at twice the global average, amplifying urban heat island effects, increasing heat stress risks, and altering precipitation patterns, leading to both flash flood.  This warming trend strains the power grid, may increase transportation costs, resulting significant impacts daily activities. Our project aims to analyse historical weather patterns to understand climate trends and their implications for Singapore’s environment and daily life.\nObjective\nThe project addresses critical issues related to climate change in Singapore by visualizing historical weather data to identify long-term trends. We aim to examine the health impacts of climate change by correlating weather data with records from the National Environment Agency (NEA), focusing on vector-borne diseases like dengue. Understanding these links can help public health authorities implement better preventive measures. We also investigate the impact of rising temperatures on electricity demand and the effects of extreme weather on transportation networks and commuting behaviours. Our goal is to provide actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and public health officials to develop effective and holistic climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, enhancing awareness and contributing to a more climate-resilient Singapore.\nData Sets\nWe will integrate multiple data sets from different government agencies, primarily historical weather data from the Meteorological Service Singapore, which includes temperature trends, rainfall patterns, humidity levels, and extreme weather events. Additionally, we will use:\n\nElectricity consumption statistics from the Energy Market Authority (EMA) to examine the correlation between rising temperatures and increased electricity demand.\nDengue case data from the NEA to evaluate public health implications of climate change.\nPrivate hire vehicle data from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to analyze how extreme weather events influence commuting behaviors and transport demand.\n\nBy combining these data sets, our project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of how climate change affects various aspects of daily life in Singapore."

    "text": "2. Objective\nOur project aims to address several critical problems related to climate change in Singapore. One of the key objectives is to understand long-term climate trends by visualizing historical weather data, which will allow us to identify patterns such as rising temperatures, increased humidity, and extreme weather events.\nAnother important aspect of this study is examining the health impacts of climate change. By correlating weather data with records from the National Environment Agency (NEA), we aim to study the increase in the spread of vector-borne diseases like dengue. Dengue is one of the major climate-related health issues in Singapore, as warmer temperatures and increased rainfall create ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes, leading to a surge in dengue cases. Understanding this links can help public health authorities implement better preventive measures and policies to mitigate health risks associated with climate change.\nIn addition to health concerns, climate change also has significant implications for energy consumption. As temperatures rise, the demand for electricity, particularly for cooling purposes, is expected to increase. Investigating these patterns will help us assess the impact of climate change on Singapore’s energy needs and inform sustainable energy policies that balance efficiency and environmental responsibility.\nFurthermore, extreme weather events can disrupt transportation networks and affect commuting behaviors. Our project will explore the impact of weather conditions on taxi and hitch-hiring demand. By analysing these trends, we aim to provide insights that can support transportation planning and improve urban mobility resilience in the face of climate change.\nOverall, our project seeks to provide actionable insights that can guide policymakers, urban planners, and public health officials in developing effective climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. By presenting our findings through visual analytics, we aim to enhance awareness of climate challenges and contribute to Singapore’s efforts in building a more climate-resilient future."

    "section": "5. Literature Review",
    "text": "5. Literature Review\nWe analyzed six research articles in relation to our project topic:\n1)  Climatic influence on electricity consumption: The case of Singapore and Hong Kong - Singapore’s yearly electricity consumption may rise by 3-4% for every degree Celsius that the temperature rises, with the residential sector bearing most of the increase. Singapore’s major electricity user, with less seasonality than Hong Kong, is the industrial sector. The overall fluctuation is generally low, while the demand for power is higher in the commercial and residential sectors during the hotter months. The impact of temperature variations on power usage is assessed using two analytical techniques in this study: the time-series approach (uses monthly data from 1990 to 2015) and the decomposition approach (divides consumption into trend, seasonal, cyclical, and irregular components). The findings indicate that, while temperature has a statistically significant impact on energy use, particularly in the residential sector, the total effect is not as strong as it is in Hong Kong.\n2) Impact of climate change and socioeconomic factors on domestic energy consumption: The case of Hong Kong and Singapore -  The study examines Singapore’s energy usage using LMG (Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold Method) and PMVD (Proportional Marginal Variance Decomposition) techniques, and it finds that climatic factors such as the heat index and monsoon have a greater impact than population and GDP. According to the Generalized Additive Model (log-transformed to account for non-linear relationships) for Energy Consumption, humidity and temperature increase rather than decrease energy consumption. Using six CMIP5 models, future climate forecasts forecast higher energy demand, particularly in the residential sector. By 2100, Singapore’s environment is expected to stay tropical rainforest and extend north which could change the regional energy trends.\n3) Impact of climate change on dengue fever epidemics in South and Southeast Asian settings: A modelling study -\nThe study examines dengue transmission in Singapore using an SEI-SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model. To account for temperature-dependent characteristics including bite rate, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito mortality rate, it divides human and mosquito populations into several stages of infection. Future temperatures and precipitation under three climate change scenarios are simulated using climate models from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Dengue forecasts for Singapore are based on daily rainfall and temperature data from 2012 to 2020. The most important temperature-dependent parameters were identified by uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, which revealed that dengue transmission is greatly enhanced by higher mosquito biting frequency and lower death in ideal warm conditions.\n4) Impact of extreme weather on dengue fever infection in four Asian countries: A modelling analysis -\nThe paper analyzes dengue risk in each study location using a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) and a two-stage meta-analysis. The DLNM accounts for nonlinear connections by capturing the delayed impacts of rainfall and temperature on dengue risk. To account for overdispersion of dengue cases, the study uses a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a quasi-Poisson Distribution. Public holidays, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and temperature are examples of independent variables. For regional adjustment, the Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) methodology is employed, which reduces estimation errors and yields more trustworthy country-specific results by enabling smaller sample sites to draw strength from bigger datasets.\n5) A Review and Case Analysis of the Impact of Weather Factors on Public Transportation in Singapore - The study investigates how weather factors affect the efficiency of transportation. High temperatures increase the number of passengers on the MRT, and heavy rains results in lengthier bus wait times, according to a Pearson correlation test. A multivariate linear regression model measures how each weather variable affects the effectiveness of public transportation. Demand patterns are impacted by temperature, while delays are most affected by rainfall. Bus and train delays are predicted with good accuracy (approx. 85%) via a Random Forest machine learning algorithm."

    "section": "1. Motivation & Background",
    "text": "1. Motivation & Background\nClimate change has become an increasingly urgent issue, with its effects becoming more noticeable worldwide. Singapore, as a tropical island nation, faces significant challenges due to climate change, including rising temperatures, increased humidity, more frequent extreme weather events, and rising sea levels. These environmental changes have far-reaching implications for public health, urban infrastructure, energy consumption, and economic resilience.\nOver the past decades, Singapore has experienced a steady increase in temperature, with annual mean temperatures rising at twice the global average. This warming trend amplify urban heat island effects, increasing the risk of heat stress and related health concerns. Additionally, changes in precipitation patterns may lead to more intense rainfall events and prolonged dry spells, contributing to both flooding and water resource management issues. The rising temperatures also have economic consequences, as higher cooling demands strain the power grid, and extreme weather events disrupt transportation and daily activities.\nGiven the substantial impact of climate change on Singapore, it is crucial to analyse historical weather patterns to understand trends and potential future scenarios. By using meteorological data, we can gain deeper insights into how climate change is shaping Singapore’s environment and every day’s life. Our project seeks to visualize and analyse these climate trends, providing valuable insights into the evolving climate landscape of Singapore and its broader implications."

    "text": "2. Objective\nSG ClimateViz aims to understand critical problems related to climate change in Singapore. One of the key objectives is to understand long-term climate trends by visualizing historical weather data, which will allow us to identify patterns such as rising temperatures, increased humidity, and extreme weather events.\nAnother important aspect of this study is examining the health impacts of climate change. By correlating weather data with records from the National Environment Agency (NEA), we aim to study the increase in the spread of vector-borne diseases like dengue. Dengue is one of the major climate-related health issues in Singapore, as warmer temperatures and increased rainfall create ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes, leading to a surge in dengue cases. Understanding this links can help public health authorities implement better preventive measures and policies to mitigate health risks associated with climate change.\nIn addition to health concerns, climate change also has significant implications for energy consumption. As temperatures rise, the demand for electricity, particularly for cooling purposes, is expected to increase. Investigating these patterns will help us assess the impact of climate change on Singapore’s energy needs and inform sustainable energy policies that balance efficiency and environmental responsibility.\nOverall, by presenting our findings through visual analytics, SG ClimateViz team aim to enhance awareness of climate challenges and contribute to Singapore’s efforts in building a more climate-resilient future."

Our primary data set will be historical weather data from the Meteorological Service Singapore, which will provide information on temperature trends, rainfall patterns, humidity levels, and extreme weather events over the years. This data will serve as the foundation for identifying climate-related changes and their potential consequences.\nIn addition to weather data, we will incorporate a few other data sets with the following purposes:\n1. Electricity consumption statistics from the Energy Market Authority (EMA): This data set will allow us to examine the correlation between rising temperatures and increased electricity demand.\n2.Dengue case data from the National Environment Agency (NEA): By correlating dengue incidence rates with weather patterns, we aim to identify trends and evaluate the public health implications of climate change.\nBy combining these data sets, our project will provide a comprehensive analysis of how climate change affects various aspects of everyday life in Singapore."

    "section": "5. Literature Review",
    "text": "5. Literature Review\nWe analyzed six research articles in relation to our project topic:\n1)  Climatic influence on electricity consumption: The case of Singapore and Hong Kong - Singapore’s yearly electricity consumption may rise by 3-4% for every degree Celsius that the temperature rises, with the residential sector bearing most of the increase. Singapore’s major electricity user, with less seasonality than Hong Kong, is the industrial sector. The overall fluctuation is generally low, while the demand for power is higher in the commercial and residential sectors during the hotter months. The impact of temperature variations on power usage is assessed using two analytical techniques in this study: the time-series approach (uses monthly data from 1990 to 2015) and the decomposition approach (divides consumption into trend, seasonal, cyclical, and irregular components). The findings indicate that, while temperature has a statistically significant impact on energy use, particularly in the residential sector, the total effect is not as strong as it is in Hong Kong.\n2) Impact of climate change and socioeconomic factors on domestic energy consumption: The case of Hong Kong and Singapore -  The study examines Singapore’s energy usage using LMG (Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold Method) and PMVD (Proportional Marginal Variance Decomposition) techniques, and it finds that climatic factors such as the heat index and monsoon have a greater impact than population and GDP. According to the Generalized Additive Model (log-transformed to account for non-linear relationships) for Energy Consumption, humidity and temperature increase rather than decrease energy consumption. Using six CMIP5 models, future climate forecasts forecast higher energy demand, particularly in the residential sector. By 2100, Singapore’s environment is expected to stay tropical rainforest and extend north which could change the regional energy trends.\n3) Impact of climate change on dengue fever epidemics in South and Southeast Asian settings: A modelling study -\nThe study examines dengue transmission in Singapore using an SEI-SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model. To account for temperature-dependent characteristics including bite rate, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito mortality rate, it divides human and mosquito populations into several stages of infection. Future temperatures and precipitation under three climate change scenarios are simulated using climate models from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Dengue forecasts for Singapore are based on daily rainfall and temperature data from 2012 to 2020. The most important temperature-dependent parameters were identified by uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, which revealed that dengue transmission is greatly enhanced by higher mosquito biting frequency and lower death in ideal warm conditions.\n4) Impact of extreme weather on dengue fever infection in four Asian countries: A modelling analysis -\nThe paper analyzes dengue risk in each study location using a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) and a two-stage meta-analysis. The DLNM accounts for nonlinear connections by capturing the delayed impacts of rainfall and temperature on dengue risk. To account for overdispersion of dengue cases, the study uses a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a quasi-Poisson Distribution. Public holidays, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and temperature are examples of independent variables. For regional adjustment, the Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) methodology is employed, which reduces estimation errors and yields more trustworthy country-specific results by enabling smaller sample sites to draw strength from bigger datasets.\n5) A Review and Case Analysis of the Impact of Weather Factors on Public Transportation in Singapore - The study investigates how weather factors affect the efficiency of transportation. High temperatures increase the number of passengers on the MRT, and heavy rains results in lengthier bus wait times, according to a Pearson correlation test. A multivariate linear regression model measures how each weather variable affects the effectiveness of public transportation. Demand patterns are impacted by temperature, while delays are most affected by rainfall. Bus and train delays are predicted with good accuracy (approx. 85%) via a Random Forest machine learning algorithm.\nClick here to view SG ClimateViz’s Shiny App."

Spatial Interpolation of Mean Temperature\nBoth maps of Mean Temperature Distribution appear visually identical, indicating that the temperature predictions are not significantly affected by variogram parameter adjustments. This suggests that the temperature trends are well captured by both approaches.\n2. Kriging Variance Comparison\n\nAuto Variogram:\n\nThe kriging variance is more evenly distributed, with slightly lower uncertainty in central regions.The pattern of variance seems more smooth, likely due to default parameters optimizing a general fit.\n\nManual Variogram Adjustments:\n\nThe variance map shows more pronounced patches of uncertainty in different locations.\nThe kriging variance is more localized, suggesting that the manual tuning has affected the spatial relationships between points.\nThis could indicate that the manually chosen sill, range, and model parameters have led to more refined spatial dependence assumptions."

Local Moran’s I: shows clusters and outliers of mean temperature based on spatial autocorrelation.\n\nDarker green areas (higher Moran’s I values) indicate strong positive spatial autocorrelation, meaning these regions have neighboring areas with similar temperature values.\nLighter green areas (lower Moran’s I values) suggest weaker spatial autocorrelation or more dispersed temperature patterns.\nLight purple areas (negative Moran’s I values) might indicate potential spatial outliers where temperature values differ significantly from their neighbors.\nStrong positive clusters (dark green) are seen in the northwest and central regions of Singapore, meaning these areas have consistently high or low mean temperatures.\nThe southern and eastern regions appear to have weaker spatial autocorrelation, suggesting more temperature variability or transition zones between different temperature regimes.\n\n\n2. P-Value of Local Moran’s I: assesses the statistical significance of the Local Moran’s I results.\n\nPurple areas (low p-values, &lt;0.2) indicate strong evidence that spatial clustering is significant (i.e., temperature patterns are not random).\nGreen areas (higher p-values, &gt;0.6) suggest weaker or non-significant spatial autocorrelation, meaning that any apparent clustering might be due to chance.\nWhite areas (mid-range p-values, 0.4-0.6) indicate moderate evidence, suggesting inconclusive clustering.\nThe northern and central regions have significant clustering (dark purple), reinforcing that these areas show clear spatial dependence in temperature.\nSome southwestern areas have higher p-values, meaning the detected clusters there might not be statistically significant.\n\n\n\nStep 7: Plot LISA Map for significant Local Moran’s I results (p-value &lt; 0.05) using tmap.\n\nlisa_sig &lt;- kriged_sf %&gt;%\n  filter(p_ii_sim &lt; 0.05)\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n# LISA Map with polygon borders\ntm_shape(kriged_sf) +\n  tm_polygons() +  \n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_title(\n    text = \"LISA Map\",\n    size = 0.5  # Adjust title size\n  ) +\n  tm_shape(lisa_sig) +  \n  tm_fill(\"mean\", \n          fill.scale = tm_scale(palette = \"brewer.rd_bu\", midpoint = 0),\n          legend.show = TRUE) +  \n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights from LISA map\n\n\n\n1. High-High Clusters (Green Areas): These regions have high temperatures surrounded by high temperatures, indicating strong positive spatial autocorrelation.\n\nObserved in:\n\nCentral Region (Bishan, Ang Mo Kio)\nSouthern coastal areas & islands (Sentosa, Southern Islands, possibly Marina South)\n\nImplications:\n\nThe central region is likely experiencing an urban heat island (UHI) effect due to dense urbanization.\nCoastal/southern clusters may be influenced by heat-retaining surfaces and lower vegetation cover.\n\n\n\n2. Low-Low Clusters (Red Areas): These areas have low temperatures surrounded by low temperatures, forming another significant cluster.\n\nObserved in:\n\nNorthwestern Singapore (Lim Chu Kang, Kranji, parts of Woodlands and western regions)\n\nImplications:\n\nThese areas tend to have more greenery, agricultural land, and water bodies, which contribute to cooling effects.\nLess urban development may help moderate temperatures.\n\n\n\n3. Non-Significant Areas (Gray): Most of the map is gray, meaning those regions do not show statistically significant clustering at the 0.05 level.\n\nTemperature patterns in these areas are more randomly distributed or do not have strong local spatial dependence for the month of April 2021.\nThe lack of strong clustering could be due to mixed land use, variable urbanization, or insufficient local temperature contrast.\n\n\nUnlike some LISA maps, there are no High-Low (blue) or Low-High (yellow) clusters for the month of April in 2021.\n\nThis suggests no strong spatial outliers (i.e., no hot spots surrounded by cold spots or vice versa).The temperature distribution is more continuous."

Rainfall in 60 min data was removed due to multi-collinearity.\nBased on the outcome of the initial model, it shows that the increase in dengue cases could not be explained by weather parameters. The correlation plot shows that dengue cases has correlation with electricity consumption.\nHence fo r model refinement, it is added to the model as a variable. The model become significant with highest 30 mins rainfall explaining the increasing trend dengue cases.\n\nmodel_health &lt;- lm(denguecases ~ MaxTemp + MinTemp + AvgMeanTemp+ Highest30minRainfall + Highest120minRainfall + Monthly_Elec_consump + DaysAbove35 , data = combined_Monthly_data)\n\nsummary(model_health)\n\n\ncheck_model(model_health)\n\n\n\n\nUsing MLR to understand the impact of climate change on electricity consumption\n\nmodel_elec &lt;- lm(Monthly_Elec_consump ~ MaxTemp + MinTemp + AvgMeanTemp+ Highest30minRainfall+ Highest60minRainfall + Highest120minRainfall+DaysAbove35, data = combined_Monthly_data)\n\nsummary(model_elec)\n\n\ncheck_c_elec &lt;- check_collinearity(model_elec)\nplot(check_c_elec)\n\n\nmodel_elec &lt;- lm(Monthly_Elec_consump ~ MaxTemp + MinTemp + AvgMeanTemp+ Highest30minRainfall + Highest120minRainfall + DaysAbove35 , data = combined_Monthly_data)\n\nsummary(model_elec)\n\n\ncheck_model(model_elec)\n\n\n\n\nConclusion and further visualization\nAlthough the MLR models may not be able to explain fully on the increase in the dengue cases and household electricity consumption over the year using the weather parameters, but the MLR models met the requirements for this exercise. The use of MLR technique is to use the weather parameters to explore if there were trends between changing weather patterns and its impact on our daily life.\n\nClimate Change on Health\nUsing the outcome of the 1st MLR model on health, although the P-value is at 0.05 which close to the conventional threshold of 0.05, this indicate the model is marginally significant, and suggest that the weather parameters used as a group does not provide a strong explanation of explaining the increase in dengue cases over the recent years.\nHowever it is important to note that among the weather parameters, Average Mean Temperature for the month and the highest 30 min rainfall are statically significant in the first model and only the highest rainfall 30 minutes is still statically significant for explaining the dengue trend after adding in the monthly total electricity consumption.\n\nggplot(combined_Monthly_data, aes(x = AvgMeanTemp, y = denguecases)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.6, size = 3) +  # Scatter plot with points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +  # Linear trend line\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Dengue Cases \\nand Average Mean Temperature \",\n    x = \"Average Daily Mean Temperature (Monthly)\",\n    y = \"Dengue Cases\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nggplot(combined_Monthly_data, aes(x = Highest30minRainfall, y = denguecases)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.6, size = 3) +  # Scatter plot with points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +  # Linear trend line\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Dengue Cases \\nand Highest 30 min Rainfall \",\n    x = \"Highest 30 min Rainfall\",\n    y = \"Dengue Cases\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nggplot(combined_Monthly_data, aes(x = Monthly_Elec_consump, y = denguecases)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.6, size = 3) +  # Scatter plot with points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +  # Linear trend line\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Dengue Cases \\nand Electricity Consumption\",\n    x = \"Monthly Household Electricity Consumption\",\n    y = \"Dengue Cases\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nClimate Change on Electricity Consumption\nBased on the MLR regression models built for the Household Electricity Consumption, the statistically significant variables are Average Mean Temperature, Highest 120 min Rainfall and Minimum Temperature. Hence the following visualization are used to show their relationship.\n\nggplot(combined_Monthly_data, aes(x = AvgMeanTemp, y = Monthly_Elec_consump)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.6, size = 3) +  # Scatter plot with points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +  # Linear trend line\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Electricity Consumption \\nand Average Mean Temperature \",\n    x = \"Average Daily Mean Temperature (Monthly)\",\n    y = \"Monthly Household Electricity Consumption\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nggplot(combined_Monthly_data, aes(x = Highest120minRainfall, y = Monthly_Elec_consump)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.6, size = 3) +  # Scatter plot with points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +  # Linear trend line\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Electricity Consumption \\nand Highest 120 min Rainfall\",\n    x = \"Highest 120 min Rainfall\",\n    y = \"Monthly Household Electricity Consumption\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nggplot(combined_Monthly_data, aes(x = MinTemp, y = Monthly_Elec_consump)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.6, size = 3) +  # Scatter plot with points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +  # Linear trend line\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Electricity Consumption \\nand Minimum Temperature\",\n    x = \"Minimum Temperature\",\n    y = \"Monthly Household Electricity Consumption\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThis take home exercise was done with reference to methods in Prof Kam’s e textbook https://r4va.netlify.app/ , materials on R available online and the use of Microsoft co-pilot to troubleshoot syntax errors and streamline codes."
