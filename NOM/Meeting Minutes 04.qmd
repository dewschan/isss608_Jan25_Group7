**Meeting 4** \
Date: 22 March, 2025 \
Venue: SOE/SCIS2 GSR 2-11 \
Main Agenda: Finalizing Analysis Modules for Shiny App, Assigning Tasks to Team Members 

**Key Discussions**

1.  **Finalization of Analysis Modules**

    -   The team reviewed the proposed analysis modules and agreed on the following three core areas for the Shiny app:

        -   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)** – Statistical insights and hypothesis testing on Singapore’s climate trends.

        -   **Time Series Forecasting** – Predicting future climate patterns and their potential implications.

        -   **Geospatial Analysis** – Mapping weather trends and climate variations across different stations.

2.  **Assignment of Modules to Team Members**

    -   Each team member will be responsible for a specific module, ensuring a structured approach to development:

        -   **Stella:** EDA & CDA – Conducting statistical analysis, visualizing trends, and validating insights.

        -   **Sathvika:** Time Series Forecasting – Developing predictive models, integrating external datasets, and analyzing seasonal trends.

        -   **Sei Sar:** Geospatial Analysis – Creating interactive maps, analyzing spatial climate trends, and performing geospatial interpolation.

3.  **General Data Preparation**

    -   Before working on individual modules, the team emphasized the need for standardized data preparation to ensure smooth integration across components.

    -   Common preprocessing tasks were discussed, such as handling missing values, ensuring consistency in date formats, and merging datasets where necessary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**To-Do List & Action Items**

**Stella:**

-   Scrape latitude and longitude data for weather stations from the Meteorological Service Singapore website.

-   Perform preliminary data cleaning and organization for EDA.

-   Identify key statistical tests for confirmatory analysis.

**Sathvika:**

-   Join additional datasets (such as dengue cases and electricity consumption) with weather data for time series forecasting.

-   Conduct initial trend analysis to explore relationships between climate variables and external factors.

-   Test different forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing) for suitability.

**Sei Sar:**

-   Finalize general data preparation steps to align the dataset structure with all team members.

-   Ensure location-based weather data is ready for geospatial visualization.

-   Research appropriate GIS techniques for mapping Singapore’s climate trends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Next Steps & Follow-Up**

-   **Midweek Check-In:** A short follow-up session will be scheduled to discuss data preparation progress.

-   **Module Development Begins:** Once data is aligned, team members will start implementing their respective analysis components.

-   **Integration & Testing:** The team will coordinate to ensure smooth integration of the different modules within the Shiny app.
