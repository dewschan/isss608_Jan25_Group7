**Meeting 2** \
Date: 24 February, 2025 \
Venue: MS Teams \
Main Agenda: Discussing datasets, refining project focus, and dividing tasks 

Key Discussions: 

-   Dataset Selection: 

<!-- -->

-   Climate Data: We discussed using historical climate data, specifically temperature and humidity levels, to understand climate change trends over time. 

<!-- -->

-   Electricity Consumption: We decided to explore the correlation between rising temperatures and electricity consumption, particularly focusing on how heatwaves may lead to increased electricity usage for cooling purposes. 

<!-- -->

-   Health Impacts: We discussed using data on heat-related health issues, such as heatstroke, heat stress, and potentially even dengue cases, as heat impacts public health. 

<!-- -->

-   Transportation Data: The idea of analysing taxi and ride-hailing data (e.g., LTA data) came up, exploring how transportation patterns might change during heatwaves or periods of extreme weather. 

<!-- -->

-   Project Focus: 

<!-- -->

-   The team agreed that the focus would primarily be on climate change's impact on public health and electricity consumption, creating a time series visualization of how these factors evolve over time. 

<!-- -->

-   We would analyse the relationship between temperature and health outcomes, particularly dengue cases, while also considering energy consumption. 

Tasks to Complete: 

-   Dataset Collection: 

<!-- -->

-   Each member was assigned to find relevant datasets by Wednesday evening. 

<!-- -->

-   Sathvika: Search for historical climate data (temperature, humidity) from meteorological sources. 

<!-- -->

-   Sei Sar: Look for electricity consumption data from energy providers or governmental sources. 

<!-- -->

-   Stella: Research heat-related health data (e.g., heatstroke and heat stress data). 

Next Meeting Agenda: 

-   Review progress on data collection and discuss data cleaning and preparation strategies. 

<!-- -->

-   Finalize the overall direction of the project and the specific visualizations to create. 

To Do Before Next Meeting: 

-   All team members: Complete the dataset search and share findings by Sunday night.
