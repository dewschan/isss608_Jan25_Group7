**Meeting 3** \
Date: 2 March, 2025 \
Venue: MS Teams \
Main Agenda: Reviewing datasets, preparing data for analysis, and crafting project proposal 

Key Discussions: 

-   Dataset Review: 

<!-- -->

-   Climate Data: Still in the process of crawling the web for lastest data 

<!-- -->

-   Electricity Consumption: Energy usage data, with breakdowns by household and commercial sectors. The team discussed using seasonal decomposition techniques to analyse how consumption patterns change during hotter months. 

<!-- -->

-   Health Data: Heat-related illness datasets such as dengue showed in certain months. Preliminary checks indicated that these peaks coincided with periods of higher temperatures. 

<!-- -->

-   Transportation Data: LTA ride-hailing and taxi demand data was presented, showing increased trips during hotter periods. This could provide insights into how extreme weather impacts mobility patterns. 

<!-- -->

-   Data Preprocessing: 

<!-- -->

-   Agreed on the following preprocessing steps: 

<!-- -->

-   Standardize time formats across all datasets. 

<!-- -->

-   Handle missing values by interpolation for climate data and mean imputation for health and electricity datasets. 

<!-- -->

-   Normalize continuous variables to ensure consistent scales across different datasets. 

<!-- -->

-   Proposal Crafting: 

<!-- -->

-   The team brainstormed the structure of the project proposal, with the following sections: 

<!-- -->

-   Introduction: Overview of climate change and its impacts on public health, electricity consumption, and transportation patterns. 

<!-- -->

-   Objective/Research Questions: 

<!-- -->

-   How does climate change affect electricity consumption patterns in Singapore? 

<!-- -->

-   Is there a significant relationship between rising temperatures and heat-related health issues? 

<!-- -->

-   How do transportation patterns change during extreme weather events? 

<!-- -->

-   Methodology: 

<!-- -->

-   Time series visualization using fable and ggplot2. 

<!-- -->

-   Correlation analysis between temperature and other datasets. 

<!-- -->

-   Data Sources: List of all datasets obtained and their descriptions. 

<!-- -->

-   Literature Review: To build on previously done research 

<!-- -->

-   Expected Outcomes/Storyboard: Insights into how climate change impacts daily life and potential recommendations for policymakers. 

<!-- -->

-   Project Timeline: 

<!-- -->

-   Week 1: Data collection and preprocessing 

<!-- -->

-   Week 2-3: Exploratory data analysis and visualizations, Correlation analysis and initial findings, Build Shiny-App 

<!-- -->

-   Week 4: Deeper Visualizations with CDA on Shiny-App 

Tasks to Complete: 

-   Sei Sar: Draft the Introduction and Data Sources sections. 

<!-- -->

-   Stella: Write the Methodology section and start creating time series visualizations for climate and electricity data 

<!-- -->

-   Sathvika: Write the Literature Review section. 

Next Meeting Agenda: 

-   Review first draft of the proposal. 

<!-- -->

-   Discuss early visualizations and findings. 

To Do Before Next Meeting: 

-   Have the first draft of the proposal ready by Mar 9 Sunday night. 

<!-- -->

-   Share initial visualizations in the team groupchat for feedback.
