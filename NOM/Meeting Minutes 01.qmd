**Meeting 1** \
Date: 17 February, 2025 \
Venue: MS Teams \
Main Agenda: Selection of Project Topic and Initial Project Scope Discussion 

Key Discussions: 

-   Project Topic: The team decided on Climate Change as the project topic due to its relevance and potential for insightful time series visualizations. 

<!-- -->

-   Justification: 

<!-- -->

-   Climate data provides long-term trends that are suitable for time series analysis. 

<!-- -->

-   The topic allows for the integration of multiple publicly available datasets across different domains (health, energy, transportation). 

<!-- -->

-   Findings can generate actionable insights with social and policy implications. 

<!-- -->

-   Potential Data Sources to Research: 

<!-- -->

-   MOM: Workplace safety incidents related to heat stress. 

<!-- -->

-   MOH: Cases of heatstroke and heat stress across different months. 

<!-- -->

-   Electricity Consumption: Analysing energy demand patterns during hotter periods. 

<!-- -->

-   Dengue Cases: Possible correlation between temperature rise and dengue outbreaks. 

<!-- -->

-   LTA: Taxi and ride-hailing demand during extreme weather events. 

<!-- -->

-   Any other climate-related datasets that could provide additional insights. 

To Do Next: 

-   Each team member to research and propose relevant datasets by next week. 

<!-- -->

-   Create a shared document to list down dataset details (source, description, format, and availability). 

<!-- -->

-   Shortlist datasets to be used in the project based on availability and relevance. 

Next Meeting Agenda: 

-   Review proposed datasets. 

<!-- -->

-   Finalize dataset selection. 

<!-- -->

-   Outline preliminary data cleaning steps.
