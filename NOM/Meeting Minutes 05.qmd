**Meeting 5**\
Date: 27 March, 2025\
**Venue:** MS Teams\
**Main Agenda:** Progress Review on Analysis Modules, Addressing Challenges, and Next Steps

### **Key Discussions**

#### **Progress Updates on Analysis Modules**

Each team member provided an update on their respective tasks and analysis modules:

-   **Stella: EDA & CDA**

    -   Completed preliminary data cleaning and organization.

    -   Identified key statistical tests for confirmatory analysis and began initial hypothesis testing.

-   **Sathvika: Time Series Forecasting**

    -   Integrated additional datasets (dengue cases, electricity consumption) with weather data.

    -   Conducted initial trend analysis and explored relationships between climate variables and external factors.

-   **Sei Sar: Geospatial Analysis**

    -   Finalized general data preparation to align with all modules.

    -   Ensured location-based weather data is structured for geospatial visualization.

    -   Researched GIS techniques for mapping climate trends and began implementing spatial interpolation methods.

#### **Challenges & Resolutions**

-   **Data Integration Issues**

    -   Some inconsistencies were found in date formats and missing values in external datasets.

    -   Action: Implement a standardized data merging approach and handle missing values with appropriate imputation techniques.

-   **Computational Challenges in Forecasting**

    -   Running ARIMA on large datasets took longer than expected.

    -   Action: Optimize model selection criteria and consider dimensionality reduction techniques if necessary.

-   **Geospatial Data Visualization Complexity**

    -   Challenges in aligning kriging outputs with Singapore’s regional boundaries.

    -   Action: Cross-check GIS mapping with different interpolation methods to refine accuracy.

### **To-Do List & Action Items**

-   **Stella:**

    -   Finalize EDA visualizations and statistical summaries.

    -   Validate confirmatory tests and interpret significant findings.

-   **Sathvika:**

    -   Select the best-performing forecasting model and refine predictions.

    -   Document insights from external factor analysis and forecasting.

-   **Sei Sar:**

    -   Implement spatial analysis with Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation such as Local Moran’s I and p-values.

    -   Finalize geospatial mapping and assess climate trends across Singapore.

### **Next Steps & Follow-Up**

-   Team members will enhance and refine their respective components based on feedback.

-   Once individual modules are complete, they will be integrated into the Shiny app for testing and validation.
