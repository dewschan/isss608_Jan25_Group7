Climate change is reshaping Singapore’s environment, with rising temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, and increasing extreme weather events. These changes affect public health, energy consumption, and urban infrastructure. By analyzing historical weather data, we aim to uncover trends and provide valuable insights to help Singapore adapt to a changing climate.

The objectives for this project are as follows:

-   **Understanding Climate Trends:** Analyzing temperature, humidity, and precipitation changes over time.

-   **Public Health Impacts:** Exploring links between climate trends and the rise in vector-borne diseases like dengue.

-   **Energy Consumption:** Examining the relationship between rising temperatures and electricity demand.

-   **Urban Mobility:** Investigating how weather conditions affect transport patterns, including taxi and ride-hailing demand.

#### **Key Features**

-   **Interactive Data Visualization:** Users can explore climate trends through dynamic charts and geospatial maps.

-   **Correlated Insights:** Integration of multiple datasets (weather, health, energy, and transport) for a holistic analysis.

-   **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for policymakers, researchers, and the public to easily access and interpret climate data.
