The **SG ClimateViz** team is developing an interactive application to uncover how climate change influences key aspects of daily life in Singapore, including public health, energy consumption, and urban mobility. By analyzing historical weather data, the platform provides actionable insights to help stakeholders adapt to a changing climate.

#### **Stella – Exploratory & Confirmatory Data Analysis (EDA & CDA)**

-   **Descriptive Analytics:** Generating summary statistics and visualizations, such as histograms, boxplots, and time-series plots, to reveal climate trends.

-   **Statistical Analysis:** Conducting hypothesis testing and confirmatory data analysis to validate key findings on climate variations.

#### **Sathvika – Time Series Forecasting & Trend Analysis**

-   **Predictive Modeling:** Applying forecasting techniques like ARIMA and exponential smoothing to predict future climate variations.

-   **Performance Evaluation:** Assessing forecast accuracy and interpreting long-term weather patterns to inform climate adaptation strategies.

#### **Sei Sar – Geospatial Interpolation & Analysis**

-   **Spatial Climate Mapping:** Visualizing temperature and precipitation changes across different locations using GIS techniques.

-   **Geospatial Interpolation:** Implementing methods such as Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) to analyze spatial weather variations.

Together, these modules ensure that **SG ClimateViz** delivers a comprehensive, data-driven understanding of Singapore’s evolving climate.
