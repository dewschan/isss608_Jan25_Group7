The **SG ClimateViz** team is developing an interactive application to uncover how climate change influences key aspects of daily life in Singapore, including public health, energy consumption, and urban mobility. By analyzing historical weather data, the platform provides actionable insights to help stakeholders adapt to a changing climate.

To achieve this, **SG ClimateViz** is structured into specialized analysis modules, each led by a team member:

1.  **Stella – Exploratory & Confirmatory Data Analysis (EDA & CDA)**

    -   Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure high-quality datasets.

    -   Summary statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, boxplots, time-series trends).

    -   Hypothesis testing and statistical validation to support key findings.

2.  **Sathvika – Univariate Forecasting & Trend Analysis**

    -   Time series decomposition to understand seasonality and trends.

    -   Application of forecasting techniques such as ARIMA to predict climate variations.

    -   Evaluating forecast accuracy and interpreting long-term weather patterns.

3.  **Sei Sar – Geospatial Interpolation & Climate Change Impact Analysis**

    -   Mapping temperature and precipitation changes over time using GIS techniques.

    -   Implementing interpolation methods like Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) for spatial analysis.

    -   Identifying spatial climate trends and their implications for Singapore’s environment.

Together, these modules ensure that **SG ClimateViz** delivers a comprehensive, data-driven understanding of Singapore’s evolving climate.
