The team aims to build an app that provides insights into how climate change influences various aspects of daily life in Singapore, including public health, energy consumption, and urban mobility

The following is the breakdown of the analysis modules for each team member:

1.⁠ ⁠**Stella** – EDA & CDA

-   Data cleaning and preprocessing

-   Summary statistics and visualisations (histograms, boxplots, time-series trends)

-   Hypothesis testing and statistical validation

2.⁠ ⁠**Sathvika** – Univariate Forecasting & Trend Analysis

-   Time series decomposition

-   ARIMA or other forecasting techniques

-   Evaluating forecast accuracy and interpreting trends in weather patterns

3.**⁠ ⁠Sei Sar** – Geospatial Interpolation & Climate Change Impact Analysis

-   Mapping temperature and precipitation changes over time using GIS techniques

-   Interpolation methods like IDW (Inverse Distance Weighting)

-   Analyzing spatial trends and their implications for climate change
